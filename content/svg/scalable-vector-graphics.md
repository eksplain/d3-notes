SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML based vector image format for 2D graphics. Read the entire specification  [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/) if you are feeling brave.

Traditionally, graphics used the raster graphics or bitmap format, where each pixel in the image is assigned a color. The glaring problem with this format is that they are resolution dependent. They cannot scale up to an arbitrary resolution without loss in quality, a phenomenon popularly known as pixelation.

Vector graphics on the other hand, are not defined by the pixel, but in terms of 2D points, connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. The flash player primarily used vector graphics(not SVG) for drawing and animation, making the graphics seem rich and scalable.

SVG is a format that allows three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images and text.  The graphics are defined in XML syntax and it allows the objects to be grouped, transformed and animated.
